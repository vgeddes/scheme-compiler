Another Scheme Compiler

Still in early development!

Current design
==============

* CPS high-level IR [DONE]
  Raw scheme source code undergoes macro-expansion, alpha-conversion, CPS conversion, 
  lambda lifting, closure conversion, and then conversion to the Tree IR
* Tree-based low-level IR [DONE]
  Currently only used as a convenient source IR for near-optimal instruction selection
* x86-64 code generator [DONE]
  Uses a near-optimal maximal munch algorithm
* linear-scan register allocator [TODO]
* Assembler [TODO]

Written in Scheme!
